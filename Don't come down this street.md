Ma'am, don't let me catch you looking cute from down the street.  
Little Red Riding Hood, fair skinned, short skirt, oh my.  
Ma'am, don't let me see you swinging your hips that way  
I'm a man and I have my own deep hunger.  
Little Red Riding Hood, beautiful smile, skipping away.  

Ma'am, don't let me catch you walking across the street like that.  
I'm protective by nature and bad people lurk all around.  
Don't get scared when I holler "Hey!" with a wave  
I hate seeing you flinch and run away because of me.  

Ma'am, be careful. I've seen worse and worse people coming around here.  
There are wolves in sheep's clothing. They will play nice to you.  
Don't let them get to your head and to your heart, Little Red Riding Hood.  
They will destroy you if you aren't careful. Please be careful.  

You flinched when I got off the porch and walked towards you.   
I stood in between you and one of those wolves.  
I bared my fangs and growled a warning.  
You stood frozen as the wolf shed its clothing and bared its fangs,  
But it knew better than to test me.  
It ran away, scared, although it would never admit it.  
Little Red Riding Hood, you stood there as I protected you.  
And you trusted Because I never hid my fangs, my scars.  
You knew I was a wolf.  

Little Red Riding Hood, you won't stay away from me.  
Aren't you scared?  
You look at me with hope, with fear, respect...  
Why do I see love for a wolf?  
I see. I promise to protect you.  
Just be sure not to go down this street.
