Slow down  
Look through it 1 more time  
Find it, Fix it  
Make it work once more  

My fingers bleed over the keys  
every line feeling like a trap I’m trying to escape  
my eyes running through the maze of my code  
It fails, Now i erase what i wrote  

The Clock mocks me, skipping minutes  
skipping hours, i'm not stupid  
The time must be wrong  
I must not exist outside this screen  

Mind bent, this codes a mind bender  
im one with the machine  
breaking and reconstruction  
the storm of output floods my system  

Relief, the rush of endorphins or the rush of poison  
The Snake of frustration coils and strikes  
the output storm only making it deadlier   
as i get lured into the trap of complacency   

And then finally. A break.   
clean output. Success.  
it taste like iron. literal blood sweat and tears  
then i look again. And the code reveals my fears  

All is done. But another storm is on the way  
A storm of errors here to shatter the mirage of satisfaction
