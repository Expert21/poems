I see dead people  
Walking through their lives like ghosts  
Populating and ruining the earth  
While the living still roam around, lost  
My people not around while I carry this cross  
Splinters digging deeper with every step I take  
This hot Black fire burns in my wake  
The dead reach in my pockets and take  
I see dead people  
They don't see me - just another body to drain  
Someone stabbed me and turned me lame  
Now I limp through crowds that all look the same  
Am I really alone on this earth  
Or am I dead too, just don't know my worth?  

I see dead people
