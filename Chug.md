"Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!"

Thats what kept playing in my head as i walked  
taking my time, 1 foot in front of the other  
Every few minutes checking the time and thinking of you.  
I checked in, How far along are you?  
You said you wanted to get fucked up with me and i really liked that idea  
in the safety of your home, unhinged. fun.  
We both knew that i was going to take advantage.  
but im respectful, i made sure it was ok with you 3 times  
but then you made me mad, so i said "take 15 shots before i get there"  
That was dangerous, It was insane. But you did it. and Oh my Gosh  
Who you became in that moment was precious, it was scary. Vulnerable  
I reaffirmed you, saying "you arent that drunk, just a little bit"  
Part of me didnt even want to do anything, Then you threw up.  
yea i definitely dont want to do anything now.  
I wasnt disgusted, i was concerned. i took care of you as you threw up for 30 minutes, 3 different times.   
You chugged the drank  
I didnt want you to chug it for this reason  

but for some reason i was aroused.  
When you was done, i cleaned you up and you couldnt even support yourself  
walking you back to your bed was hard but we did it  
you apologized for throwing up, for chugging when you knew you shouldnt  
but i said its fine. no need to apologize. Then i laid you down and you passed out...  

A few minutes later, I took advantage and you didnt wake up  
the thrill was extremely arousing. your body was reacting.  
Almost like even while you was sleep you wanted more.  

When you woke up, you didn't remember the act, didnt truly feel it  
but i didnt hide it for you. I told you everything  
And you smiled and said "I'm glad you at least had your fun"  
geez you're too precious too me  


If only God didn't say no
