Hey, are you ok?

I understand that completely sometimes you just have to...

Oh! really? Thats....interesting because i like you too...

Im always here for you. No matter what.

I love you...

I hate myself.
How could i let myself be distracted.

i promise i love you. I love you with everything.. Im so sorry

I made you feel something that i promised i never would...
**Heartbreak**




Hey there..

How are you doing?

Thats good thats good. 

Me? Oh nothing im just writing a song

Yea sometimes but im not good.

I know i just have to...

Hey, what made you admit to me that you loved me?

I see i see, Well im sorry for being weird about it before. I love you

No you dont, i love You more 


Stop! omg i swear i cant get No time to myself. No time to my friends.

No im done with this. I trusted you. I took a nap on your lap and you decided to go through my phone??
Dont you trust me?

No Stop. Im done
You made me feel something i never thought i would with you
**Heartbreak**


Now look at me now, Im grown and proud   
I reach out, get no reply, realize im just another body in the crowds  
Every chance i got i ruined, I made the person who loved me with everything want to avoid me like the plague  
Now look at me now, I've grown, I've learned, I've stood my ground  
She reaches out with "I love you" but She knows the most i can give is "I Know"  
She knows i've forgiven her but theres no chance now  

I've both given and experienced **Heartbreak**
