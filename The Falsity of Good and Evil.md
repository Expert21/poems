What is Truth? It is Raw. Unwavering
Truth is strong, Unrelenting
It is what powers Life.
What is Life? It is experience, a gift
precious beyond compare
We all want more Life. But we can only get it once
So we make the most of it. 
Is that Good? Is that Evil?
Whats the point of asking?
Murdering is bad. Saving people is Good
Thats the Truth right?
well.
Was the search for Hitler with the intent of murder evil?
Is saving a serial Killer Good?
Whats the Truth in it all?
They say that the Truth will set you free, but of what?

Of the falsity of Good and Evil
