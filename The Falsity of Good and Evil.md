What is Truth? It is Raw. Unwavering <br />
Truth is strong, Unrelenting<br />
It is what powers Life.<br />
What is Life? It is experience, a gift<br />
precious beyond compare<br />
We all want more Life. But we can only get it once<br />
So we make the most of it. <br />
Is that Good? Is that Evil?<br />
Whats the point of asking?<br />
Murdering is bad. Saving people is Good<br />
Thats the Truth right?<br />
well.<br />
Was the search for Hitler with the intent of murder evil?<br />
Is saving a serial Killer Good?<br />
Whats the Truth in it all?<br />
They say that the Truth will set you free, but of what?<br />

Of the falsity of Good and Evil
