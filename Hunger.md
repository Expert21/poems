I have 3 parts, 2 minds, 1 self
3 parts interacting with the world
2 minds fighting for control
and 1 self, that experience it all
The first mind up top is finding solutions, connections, logics and feelings
but the second? oh the second

In and out, In and Out. The desperate rhythm bringing inequivalent Joy to my face, to my heart
In and out, In and out. Flip, hold tighly and adjust before going back in. 
Its a hungry i can not relinquish. 
When im with you, the second mind always thinks about the best way, the fastest way to feed
while the first mind holds it back with the whys

The second mind doesnt give a fuck. It just wants to fuck.

Up and down, deep inside and all around. I want to taste all of you
Dont do no running, you cant escape, im hungry and i know you are too
You dont run away because you are scared. You do it because its fun
Its fun, Its fun and it feels good to be in charge. 

Sometimes i think the second mind is just sleeping, dorment for the time it needs its energy
sometimes it wakes up to get fed a snack but quickly goes back to sleep
Sometimes i wish i could just get rid of it. So annoying, so Demanding like its King
But I truthfully when im with her, i realize why i keep him around.

Because I, like him, am hungry
