I have 3 parts, 2 minds, 1 self<br />
3 parts interacting with the world<br />
2 minds fighting for control<br />
and 1 self, that experience it all<br />
The first mind up top is finding solutions, connections, logics and feelings<br />
but the second? oh the second<br />

In and out, In and Out. The desperate rhythm bringing inequivalent Joy to my face, to my heart<br />
In and out, In and out. Flip, hold tighly and adjust before going back in. <br />
Its a hungry i can not relinquish. <br />
When im with you, the second mind always thinks about the best way, the fastest way to feed<br />
while the first mind holds it back with the whys<br />

The second mind doesnt give a fuck. It just wants to fuck.<br />

Up and down, deep inside and all around. I want to taste all of you<br />
Dont do no running, you cant escape, im hungry and i know you are too<br />
You dont run away because you are scared. You do it because its fun<br />
Its fun, Its fun and it feels good to be in charge. <br />

Sometimes i think the second mind is just sleeping, dorment for the time it needs its energy<br />
sometimes it wakes up to get fed a snack but quickly goes back to sleep<br />
Sometimes i wish i could just get rid of it. So annoying, so Demanding like its King<br />
But I truthfully when im with her, i realize why i keep him around.<br />

Because I, like him, am hungry<br />
