I yield. 
I give up. 
However you want to say it.

When the people around you argue and fight You have to pick a side. 
Paradoxical 
Picking a side is exactly the wrong choice

In a choice of 2, you always have 3 choices. 
In a choice of 3, the choice count is 4 
Left, right, straight... Or not moving at all

Nothing. 
Doing nothing is a choice. 
Sometimes it's the best choice. Sometimes it's the worst.

The truth is the best way to avoid pain is to be dead 
The best way to avoid Monica is to never encounter her to begin with

Once you hear of her, she's inevitable 
Whether you spend your energy avoiding her 
Or you seek her

But one thing is certain

The void is your worst enemy. 
But it's your best friend.

Remember your option to do nothing

---
She attempts to find truth. Attempts to... Be real
Be true to herself. Make you see her

She attempts to know. Shes tired of the lies
She finds no connection around her. So look her in the eyes

And tell her nothing

---
Im so sorry.
You get nothing. 
You get nothing
YOU GET NOTHING!

Stop trying. please. accept what i give
I want you to stay if blissful ignorance. 
i want to see you shine in innocence.
so you get nothing. 

No you can not know whats inside my heart
No you can not know whats on my mind
You get nothing. Talk to the Wall. Talk to a Mirror but 

You'll get nothing from me
...
...
...
Fine. 
I'll show you what its like to be me. 
You are but a child. Innocence personified.
Let me make you Human.
Let me make you... into a mirror
