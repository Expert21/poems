Hey, you. Reader.  
Yes you.  
You've seen my pain, my loneliness  
and I've become your mirror  

But Life isnt all doom and gloom isnt it?  
we love the smell of freshly cooked food going through the house.  
Get Agrivated and annoyed at the little kids running around screaming  
"AYE- SHUT UP OVER THERE!! IM TRYING TO WORK!!!"  
I can say that with a straight face and determination in my face  
but I love them. You love them.  

Remember that time you had that amazing conversation  
Really had you thinking and really had you prideful  
You didnt embarrass yourself. Good job  
Im proud of you  

Before writing this i had some food and a great conversation with my father  
we talked about cars and the "cannon ball" cross country race event with my mom  
She didnt really get the point but she was amazed  
Her confused smile and my dads low chuckle really made me feel good  
 
That girl was really pretty huh?  
nice boobs, fat ass, pretty face awww maann  
As a man, thats all i can ask of a women  
until we meet her of course..  

But she was nice. Caring. Loving even  
She didnt make fun of us, of me  
She was weird, into some weird things  
like why do you have a whole corner of your room filled with stuffed animals of Stitch  
Stitch of all characters  

The greatest joys in the world are with people you call your family.  
Birth or chosen.  
Prioritize your family. They will get you through everything.  

I love you. Now imma eat some GOOOD food!
