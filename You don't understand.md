Its been soo long, since a nigga could speak from the heart
was deep in the streets, thought i would see God
too many demons so i creep with my gun
and it hurts so much, i was always stuck, just me and my thoughts
All anyone ever seen was the things that i got
you dont understand the pain in my heart

Struggling, i been deep in my thoughts
how the fuck did i let you in and ruin me
i was tryna get a bag but you foolin me
Got you a whole pack, told you flip
a whole 1k went missing
what the fuck? whyd you do that? 
Now i call you my bro but i dont mean that
so now nobody can talk to me, i tried the street life, not for me
my girl the only one who was true to me
but now she moving away, she leaving me
so now what, im all alone
but thats the way it has to go

Its been soo long, since a nigga could speak from the heart
was deep in the streets, thought i would see God
too many demons so i creep with my gun
and it hurts so much, i was always stuck, just me and my thoughts
All anyone ever seen was the things that i got
you dont understand the pain in my heart
