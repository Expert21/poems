Its been soo long, since a ni**a could speak from the heart <br />
was deep in the streets, thought i would see God<br />
too many demons so i creep with my gun<br />
and it hurts so much, i was always stuck, just me and my thoughts<br />
All anyone ever seen was the things that i got<br />
you dont understand the pain in my heart<br />

Struggling, i been deep in my thoughts<br />
how the fuck did i let you in and ruin me<br />
i was tryna get a bag but you foolin me<br />
Got you a whole pack, told you flip<br />
a whole 1k went missing<br />
what the fuck? whyd you do that? <br />
Now i call you my bro but i dont mean that<br />
so now nobody can talk to me, i tried the street life, not for me<br />
my girl the only one who was true to me<br />
but now she moving away, she leaving me<br />
so now what, im all alone<br />
but thats the way it has to go<br />

Its been soo long, since a ni**a could speak from the heart<br />
