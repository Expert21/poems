Who are you to dictate the way that i talk?
Who are you to dictate where i go?
Who are you, that i should listen to?
Who are you to dictate my actions? 
Begone into the Void

I am King of my own castle, I built it brick by brick
All my subjects bow to me, my vessels only suggest
they can whisper in my ear, they can advise my steps
But I am King, Who are you to dictate my life?
You are not the King of kings
Begone into the void
