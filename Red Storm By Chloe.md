It hits like a lightning strike— 
sharp, electric, 
a hot blade sliding straight 
into the center of me, 
twisting, 
grinding, 
like something cruel 
is carving its initials 
into my womb.

My muscles seize, 
clench, 
drag me to my knees 
as another wave tears through— 
a violent, pulsing throb 
that feels like a fist 
wrenching my insides 
without mercy.

Heat blooms under my skin, 
my breath stutters, 
my vision blurs 
as the pain drags its nails 
down my spine 
and settles deep, 
deep, 
deep— 
a low, burning growl 
that never loosens its teeth.

I curl in tight, 
hands gripping fabric, 
jaw locked, 
waiting for the next stab, 
the next surge, 
the next cruel reminder 
that once a month 
my body becomes a battlefield—
raw, raging, 
blood-warm and unforgiving.

And still I endure it, 
shaking but unbroken— 
surviving every brutal wave 
until the storm finally 
relents.
