I am a creator
and what i create is mirrors
I make what reflects beauty
i make what reflects uglyness

I am a creator, and what i make means something
i make mirrors, and what they reflect means something
They reflect Truth, you see it even if you believe in lies
There is none who knows it all, No one is wise

I am a creator, and what i make reflects myself
I know i am not perfect, My imperfects and most apparent to myself.
So i chase the truth of things, why did i make a mirror?

I dont want to see my beauty

I dont want to see my uglyness

I want to see the Truth and reflect the Truth

I am a mirror. And i reflect what i see.
I see the beauty of life, and the uglyness of lies
I reflect what is in front of me, i show whats in me
People shatter me when they cant handle the truth

but even so

I am a mirror, and i reflect what i see
