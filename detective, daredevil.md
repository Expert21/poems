Silence her, shes too loud 
Silence hurts, im too proud 
thinking through the times when the space felt like space 
now in this space, i feel out of place 
detective, daredevil, cold case 
i sit and stare to save face

Joker, laugh Hahahaha
I feel like 2 face, voices blablabla
damn it all

im strong enough to walk through the fires of hell
but something must have latched on for a ride out
but im strong enough to wrestle with my thoughts and give myself a time out
catch me slowly walking straight to a well

i need a drink from the well of life, the well that'll never run dry
because i feel dry, parched, i feel like i might die
drink and see my pain of 1 life
float on my words, like a kite

find yourself in the pain.
learn you have something to gain

detective. daredevil. We solved the case
