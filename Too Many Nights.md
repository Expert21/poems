Too many nights i went brainless.  
Too many nights i was famous  
Too many nights i though things were alright  
too many nights that had no stars in the sky  
too many nights, ive seen only red  
too many nights, i cant sleep in my bed  
too many nights i hear yelling in my ears  
too many nights, i feel it feeding my fears  
too many nights i've gotten the wrong food  
too many nights, i got chewed up like some food  
too many nights i sit alone at my desk  
too many nights, i wanna put it all to rest  
too many nights, i believe that im depressed  
too many nights, i want to stab myself in the chest  
too many night I have stood my ground  

But its daytime so i turn my frown upside down
