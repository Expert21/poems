I miss you
but i dont remember a time we had together.
I miss you.
But i can only see your face from nearly 20 years ago
I miss you...
But the closest i can get is the sealed box of your ashes..
I miss you, my brother. 
And I'll make you proud.

Did you like that girl? she was sweet huh?
I'll help you with your homework, Your brother super smart
Come here, help me help mom with these groceries.

All of those are experiences that i wish i had with you
But you are in Heaven, I wouldn't wish you to leave paradise for me
Keep your eyes on me, Your brother
I'm going to make you proud.
I love you
