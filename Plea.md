God please let me know if you find these writings pleasing
Let me know if This is just as Solomon said, meaningless. 
chasing after the wind
Because my purpose is to serve you, Oh God
The Lover of my Soul
Keeper of my breaths. 
Thank you for watching my steps, and guiding my path
Those who live by the sword will die by the sword
But does that include the sword of the spirt?
If so thats ok, I will march boldly into battle.
Sword in hand and gun on my hip. 
And if it means i must go out 
and ruin countless perspectives in a metaphorical murder spree
Then its ok
Because i dont understand your ways, and i wouldn't dare challenge your commands

I just have to point that sword to my own flesh
because i have found myself disobedient and convicted
You have saved me but i dare to go against your word

What wickedness breeds within me. 

Oh but for Grace.

Allow me to be who you made me to be
and to reflect your glory
because I am a mirror. and i hope what you see in me is pleasing
