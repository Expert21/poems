God please let me know if you find these writings pleasing<br />
Let me know if This is just as Solomon said, meaningless. <br />
chasing after the wind<br />
Because my purpose is to serve you, Oh God<br />
The Lover of my Soul<br />
Keeper of my breaths. <br />
Thank you for watching my steps, and guiding my path<br />
Those who live by the sword will die by the sword<br />
But does that include the sword of the spirt?<br />
If so thats ok, I will march boldly into battle.<br />
Sword in hand and gun on my hip. <br />
And if it means i must go out <br />
and ruin countless perspectives in a metaphorical murder spree<br />
Then its ok<br />
Because i dont understand your ways, and i wouldn't dare challenge your commands<br />

I just have to point that sword to my own flesh<br />
because i have found myself disobedient and convicted<br />
You have saved me but i dare to go against your word<br />

What wickedness breeds within me. <br />

Oh but for Grace.<br />

Allow me to be who you made me to be<br />
and to reflect your glory<br />
because I am a mirror. and i hope what you see in me is pleasing<br />
