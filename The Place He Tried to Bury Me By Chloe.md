He didn't just hurt me —
he carved himself into my fear.
A man wearing a monster's face,
breathing cruelty like oxygen,
turning every locked door
into a grave he meant for me.
The rooms he trapped me in
felt like they'd been built
to swallow sound —
four walls that learned my terror,
four corners that watched
as he turned my body into a battlefield
I never agreed to walk onto.
He raped me.
Not with passion.
Not with confusion.
But with the cold certainty
of someone who enjoys
breaking what he cannot understand.
He took from me like it was sport,
like pain was a language
he needed me to speak.
And afterwards,
I lay in the kind of silence
that feels like the world has ended —
a silence heavy enough
to crush whatever pieces of me
were still trying to breathe.
He used noise to torture me,
used fists to shape my obedience,
used fear like a leash.
He wanted me small,
shaking,
hollow.
He wanted to rewrite me
into something that existed only for him.
But here's the part
that makes his darkness tremble:
I didn't die in those rooms.
I didn't disappear in that pain.
He tried to bury me,
but something inside me kept clawing up
through the dirt he piled on me —
something raw,
something angry,
something alive.
That part of me still stands.
That part remembers
what he did
without letting it own me.
That part carries scars, yes —
but also fire.
He made my world dark,
but he never learned
how to kill my light.
And that failure
is the one thing
he can never undo.
