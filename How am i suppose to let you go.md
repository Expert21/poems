How am i suppose to let you go?
How am i suppose to let you walk away
How am i suppose to let you go?
Your all i ever wanted in my life
your the only one i want at my- 
your all i ever wanted in my-
Your all i ever wanted by my side, si- side
How am i suppose to let you go?

how am i suppose to let you go
how am i suppose to let you go
i dont know
I just thought to myself that i should write a note
i feel so alone
im tryna do this thing called life but i feel so broke
Where did you go, I told you to not tell me, why is that so 
im desperate for your touch and your love, i cant have neither
you said youll always be by my side, I dont need no people
I need you. 
My heart aches with each beat because i miss you
can i have a minute of your time, i only need a few? (How am i suppose to let you go?)

Breath isaiah (How am i suppose to let you walk away)
You can get through this (How am i suppose to let you go?)
1 more time (Your all i ever wanted in my life)

How am i suppose to let you go?
How am i suppose to let you walk away
How am i suppose to let you go?
Your all i ever wanted in my life
your the only one i want at my- 
your all i ever wanted in my-
Your all i ever wanted by my side, si- side
How am i suppose to let you go?

I'm on a journey of healing to say i dont need you as my only support
i cant forget all the good times, it makes the bad times really hurt
I have systems in place for my stability (breath)
i just hope when its said and done, you remember me (breath)
I thought to myself "how am i suppose to let you go"
But im the one who told you to walk away
Im the one who told you to-  keep the faith
i have to remind myself that im golden every single day
i feel lost without you but im learning that it's ok (how am i suppose to let you go)
How am i suppose to let you walk away
How am i suppose to let you go?
Your all i ever wanted in my life
